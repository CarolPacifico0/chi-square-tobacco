# Chi-Square Analysis on Tobacco Data

This project explores associations between smoking habits and categorical variables using Chi-Square statistical tests in Python.

 Methods
- Chi-Square Test of Independence
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Contingency table interpretation
- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

 Structure
- `Analysis.ipynb/`: notebook with full analysis
- `Data/`: dataset used for testing
- `Images/`: plots and visualizations used in the notebook

 Tools & Libraries
- pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scipy.stats (chi2_contingency)

 Key Takeaways
